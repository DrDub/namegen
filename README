Hashes to name generator

Uses three lists:

* List of colors, distilled from doloreslabs color names v1 (see
  http://blog.doloreslabs.com/?p=17). Used last word for each color,
  cleaned mispellings by hand.

* List of animals, distilled from WordNet 3.0 (wn animal -treen,
  you'll need to patch your binary to see the whole output). Kept all
  animals that were only one word. One animal per synset, first
  one-word synonym picked.

* List of locations, distilled from YAGO 2.0 (which in turn distilled
  it from Wikipedia and other sources), postprocessed from hasArea.tsv
  (dropped all locations that required non-printable characters).

It produces verbalizations in the form 'color' 'animal' # 'left-over
number' from 'location'.

It takes a hash in base 16 as argument. With the current lists, it can
represent up to 8 positions. 10 positions works fine with a few digits
number. If the hash is small, it will produce an animal, then
color+animal and finally color+animal from location before the full form.
